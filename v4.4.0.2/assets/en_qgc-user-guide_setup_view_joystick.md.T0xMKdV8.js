When the joystick is in use (input values are changing), the joystick commands are sent to the vehicle at the (higher) frequency configured by this setting. The default is 25Hz.</p></li><li><p><strong>Button Frequency</strong>: Controls the frequency at which repeated button actions are sent.</p></li><li><p><strong>Enable Circle Correction</strong>: RC controllers sticks describe a square, while joysticks usually describe a circle. When this option is enabled a square is inscribed inside the joystick movement area to make it more like an RC controller (so it is possible to reach all four corners). The cost is decreased resolution, as the effective stick travel is reduced.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Disabled:</strong> When this is <strong>disabled</strong> the joystick position is sent to the vehicle unchanged (the way that it is read from the joystick device). On some joysticks, the (roll, pitch) values are confined to the space of a circle inscribed inside of a square. In this figure, point B would command full pitch forward and full roll right, but the joystick is not able to reach point B because the retainer is circular. This means that you will not be able to achieve full roll and pitch deflection simultaneously.</p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt=""></p></li><li><p><strong>Enabled:</strong> The joystick values are adjusted in software to ensure full range of commands. The usable area of travel and resolution is decreased, however, because the area highlighted grey in the figure is no longer used.</p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt="Circle correction enabled"></p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Deadbands:</strong> Deadbands allow input changes to be ignored when the sticks are near their neutral positions. This helps to avoid noise or small oscillations on sensitive sticks which may be interpreted as commands, or small offsets when sticks do not re-center well. They can be adjusted during the first step of the <a href="#configure">calibration</a>, or by dragging vertically on the corresponding axis monitor.</p></li></ul><h2 id="supported-joysticks" tabindex="-1">Supported Joysticks <a class="header-anchor" href="#supported-joysticks" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Supported Joysticks&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The following joysticks/controllers have been shown to work with relatively recent <em>QGroundControl</em> builds.</p><h3 id="sony-playstation-3-4-controllers" tabindex="-1">Sony Playstation 3/4 Controllers <a class="header-anchor" href="#sony-playstation-3-4-controllers" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Sony Playstation 3/4 Controllers&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Both these joysticks are highly recommended.
