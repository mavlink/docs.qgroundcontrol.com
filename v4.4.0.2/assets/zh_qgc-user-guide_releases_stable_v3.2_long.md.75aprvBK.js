After the vehicle lands from RTL and you have disconnected the battery <strong>do not</strong> disconnect QGC from the Vehicle. Put in your new battery and QGC will detect the vehicle again and automatically restore the connection. Once this happens you will be prompted with a Resume Mission confirmation slider. If you want to resume the mission, confirm this and the mission will be rebuilt from your last waypoint traveled through. Once the mission is rebuilt you will be presented with another Resume Mission slide which allows you to review the rebuilt mission before starting it again.

The reason is is that may skip over important change speed commands or camera control commands which are prior to that item in the mission. If you skipped over those the remainder of the mission will not run correctly. In order to make resume mission work correctly QGC rebuilds the mission looking backwards from the last mission item flown and automatically appends relevant commands to the front of the mission. By doing this the state of the mission prior to the resume point is restore. The following mission commands are the ones scanned for:</p><ul><li><code>MAV_CMD_DO_CONTROL_VIDEO</code></li><li><code>MAV_CMD_DO_SET_ROI</code></li><li><code>MAV_CMD_DO_DIGICAM_CONFIGURE</code></li><li><code>MAV_CMD_DO_DIGICAM_CONTROL</code></li><li><code>MAV_CMD_DO_MOUNT_CONFIGURE</code></li><li><code>MAV_CMD_DO_MOUNT_CONTROL</code></li><li><code>MAV_CMD_DO_SET_CAM_TRIGG_DIST</code></li><li><code>MAV_CMD_DO_FENCE_ENABLE</code></li><li><code>MAV_CMD_IMAGE_START_CAPTURE</code></li><li><code>MAV_CMD_IMAGE_STOP_CAPTURE</code></li><li><code>MAV_CMD_VIDEO_START_CAPTURE</code></li><li><code>MAV_CMD_VIDEO_STOP_CAPTURE</code></li><li><code>MAV_CMD_DO_CHANGE_SPEED</code></li><li><code>MAV_CMD_NAV_TAKEOFF</code></li></ul><h3 id="remove-mission-after-vehicle-lands" tabindex="-1">Remove mission after vehicle lands <a class="header-anchor" href="#remove-mission-after-vehicle-lands" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Remove mission after vehicle lands&quot;">​</a></h3><p>You will be prompted to remove the mission from the vehicle after the mission completes and the vehicle lands and disarms.
