The Fly View and Joysticks each have there own custom actions files:</p><ul><li>Fly View - FlyViewCustomActions.json</li><li>Joystick - JoystickCustomActions.json</li></ul><p>When you start up QGC it will load these files if they exist and make the commands available for use.</p>',10),n=[a];function c(u,l,m,r,d,h){return t(),e("div",null,n)}const f=o(s,[["render",c]]);export{q as __pageData,f as default};
