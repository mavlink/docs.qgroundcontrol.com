This can unfortunately indicate a number of problems:</p><ul><li>Hardware communication setup problems</li><li>Firmware problems</li></ul><p>Lastly it can happen if QGC attempts to automatically connect to a device which is connected to your computer which isn&#39;t a vehicle. You can identify this case using the steps above and noting the device information which QGC is attempting to connect to. In order to make auto-connect work the filter it uses on devices it attempts to auto-connect to is somewhat broad and can be incorrect. If you find this happening you will need to turn off auto-connect from General Settings and create a manual connection to the comm link for your vehicle. You can also remove the device causing the problem from your computer but that may not always be possible.</p>`,12),s=[a];function l(c,r,u,h,d,p){return e(),n("div",null,s)}const v=o(i,[["render",l]]);export{g as __pageData,v as default};
