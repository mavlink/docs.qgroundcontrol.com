Do a global search for those words. Make sure you are doing a case sensitive search. Also make sure you are matching whole words. It can also be helpful to exclude the <code>*.ts</code> translation files. Since they can lead to multiple results. If you do the search described here it will take you right to <code>GPSIndicatorPage.qml</code>. Some times a search may lead to many results in both qml and .cpp files. In this case limit the results to <code>*.qml</code> files.</p>',10)]))}const f=o(i,[["render",l]]);export{g as __pageData,f as default};
