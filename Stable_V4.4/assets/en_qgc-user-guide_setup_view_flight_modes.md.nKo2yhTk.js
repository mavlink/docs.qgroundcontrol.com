Each combination of switches is then encoded as a particular PWM value that will be sent on a single channel.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>The single channel is selectable on PX4 and ArduPlane, but is fixed to channel 5 on Copter.</p></div><p>The process for this varies depending on the transmitter.

Commonly this is done by encoding the positions of a 2- and a 3-position switch into a single channel, so that each switch position combination results in a different PWM value.</p><p>On the FrSky Taranis this process involves assigning a &quot;logical switch&quot; to each combination of positions of the two real switches. Each logical switch is then assigned to a different PWM value on the same channel.</p><p>This video shows how this is done with the <em>FrSky Taranis</em> transmitter: <a href="https://youtu.be/TFEjEQZqdVA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://youtu.be/TFEjEQZqdVA</a></p>',24),h=[r];function l(p,c,d,u,m,g){return a(),s("div",null,h)}const b=o(n,[["render",l]]);export{_ as __pageData,b as default};
